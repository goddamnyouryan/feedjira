      <title>Stop Daydreaming About Divorce</title>
      <description>A few years ago I spent a ton of time daydreaming about divorce. Marriage was not meeting all my expectations, especially in the area of sexual intimacy. (You can read about my marital struggles and all that we faced as newlyweds in my book The Unveiled Wife – I bet there is a lot I went through that you can ...</description>

      <title>Leading Through the Culture Wars</title>
      <description>I want an excuse not to write this post… It’s summer and I want that to involve sno-cones and water and my kids but this is burning in me. I get online and it feels like the pressure is building, like a balloon that may pop at any moment and it isn’t one complicated difficult thing, it’s so many difficult issues… ...</description>

      <title>The Value of Food</title>
      <description>Charles Dickens’ novel “Oliver Twist” was first published as a serial between 1837 and 1839. It was one of the earliest novels that contained a social slant addressing the issues of the day; particularly society’s way of turning a blind eye to child labor, and the use of children for criminal activities. By 1960, the novel found its way to ...</description>

      <title>Stop Photoshopping My Baby</title>
      <description>She looked at me and with a laugh said, “Seriously, don’t photoshop my baby…” My son is perfect in every way. I love his little nose, bright blue eyes and cute little fingers. His laugh is contagious, and his tiny toes wiggle every time we kiss him on the cheek. We’re the luckiest parents in the world, and ...</description>

      <title>How to Fail As a Leader</title>
      <description>Bill Hybels, convener of the Global Leadership Summit has said, "Everyone benefits when a leader gets better." So much of our lives and world are affected by those in leadership roles. When leaders improve, grow and become healthier, this has a great affect on the people and organizations they lead. So much of leadership is intentional improvement. If we don't ...</description>

      <title>How Our Obsession With Success May Be Hurting Our Faith</title>
      <description>Our culture is preoccupied with the self and success. America loves a winner. All cultures do, but we love them especially and I’d even say more. I remember spending time in Peru, where the pace is slow, even uncomfortably so. I daily watched farmers walk into their fields from their tiny huts and asked our hiking guide what the values ...</description>

      <title>On Defending the Ghastly</title>
      <description>The War Between the States would have ended a lot sooner if McClellan had pursued Lee after Gettysburg. Ahithophel hanged himself because his counsel of pursuit of David by Absalom was rejected (2 Sam. 17:1-2). Gideon prevailed in his great battle with Midian because he honored the principle of pursuit (Judg. 8:4). Pursuit is crucial; follow through is essential. We ...</description>

      <title>Is it okay to ask the military what happened to our freedom?</title>
      <description>I know that this is touchy. I know that we’ve been conditioned to avoid even the consideration of such thoughts and subjects. I know that even asking the question will have many tempted to immediately tar and tag me as “unpatriotic” or some sort of commie pinko who should just shut up, stop thinking such things, stop asking such questions, and just ...</description>

      <title>The One Thing Every Mom Needs to Know</title>
      <description>“I thought I had the parenting formula down.” That was what my friend said as she described her kids’ behavior and attitudes. For years, all their little bright faces, great attitudes, and constant successes were what she had always hoped for and then… what happened? One boy started to roll his eyes and talk back. His brother got a tattoo ...</description>

      <title>Why I am Letting Go Again</title>
      <description>A smiling and giggling crowd was gathering in Costco where a little girl about 7 years old was singing her heart out unaware of people coming closer to hear her belt out her favorite Disney tune, “Let it Go.” She sat in the shopping cart with her sister while her Mom was working away at the task of getting groceries. ...</description>

      <title>Watching for redemptive moments</title>
      <description>We obviously live in a very broken world and as it tumbles toward even greater post Christian moorings, the brokenness will only become greater. That is why I love the word "redemption" because our Lord loves to redeem hearts, lives, families, circumstances and even whole communities. And we are part of that redemptive process as we look for opportunities to ...</description>
